I called Sharp and they walked me thru the reset procedure with no luck, Have them set to call Jim to come out and take a look next Friday. \r\n   Note-once I was off the phone with sharp I reattached to our dm switcher and thru program was able to route video with audio to the sharp display, I did the reset to the right and also received audio so both sets are working for now but still unsure why the sets failed to begin with\r\n\r\nSharp reset config(unplug set, then while holding down input and volume down buttons plug tv in)\r\n\r\nSo to recap- Both the 1st and 10th floors are working as they should, the buggy part of the sharps on the 10th floor still should be investigated by sharp since they are so new.",

I noticed you weren't getting the satelite channels so I did a channel search and got the satellite feed working.  Checked and made sure my laptop worked at the various onterfaces on both sides room, it was setup divided. Didi testing made sure the control and routing all worked.\r\n\r\n-For the dialing issue, not able to dial into conference bridges once in the call I had to call Biamp. They logged into the system and looked into the voip control dialer config and changed a setting. They disabled outside dtmf tones, which corrected the problem at the Biamp dialer but it still didint work from the Crestron control. Art logged in and got the module communicating as it should and the problem is resolved. You can now dial access codes while in a call.\r\n\r\n-In the executive board room we could not get the Vaddio Bridge Credenza PC to come up on the display. Verified I had a signal, which I did, tried another source, still had issue. Got signal generator to rule out resolution incompatibility.  Verified I had communication between TX/RX. When we looked into the system everything looked correct, I had the signal coming into the switcher and it was routed to the correct output, but still no video. Art looked at it and couldnt see any problem. We decided to reboot the switcher, when it came back up the problem was resolved..\r\n\r\n-In the room with the Vaddio View station the system was working as it should. However I would like to get a couple installers onsite to raise the display above the speaker bar a few inches. It is to close causing a magnetic disturbance to the image quality (shadowy spot). It may fix the other image issue they seem to periodically have as well.  \r\n",

Sent it to Crestron to be repaired. They determined that the memory sdi card had failed and they replaced it. During this process the code that was stored on the SDI card was lost. We received the repaired Pro3 reinstalled it and loaded the code we had. After we loaded the loadable code some of the system features did not work.

Replaced the long Hdmi cable with a new 50ft cable. End user said it still wasn't going to be long enough I offered a HDMI coupler and a additonal 12ft HDMI cable to reach the place they wanted to set up their camera for live events. I recommended they look into a different solution since extending the HDMI via the coupler could be problematic, they should have a interface that they plug into was my recommendation rather then the long cable.\r\n-When I tested the new  50ft Cable into the HDMI/Fiber transmitter from my laptop I didi not get an image. I got a black image with a couple pixels og green and blue. I tried direct from my laptop via a 6ft hdmi cable to rule out the long cable and got the same results. I had power and link activity at the HDMI/Fiber TX. I couldnt get it to work without additional troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n-I went back to the AV closet and determined which line into the Extron HDMI switcher was tuner 2 and replaced it with the output of the Brightsign player. I did not get any content. I did some troubleshooting and determined the HDMI cable from the Brightsign player was bad. Replaced it and the Brightsign player began to work. While troubleshooting this issue, I located the HDMI/Fiber RX that receives the feed from the long cable out at the left display. I had power and link activity. I hooked my laptop direct into the HDMI Switcher Input 7 which was from the HDMI/Fiber RX I was able to share my laptop to the displays. I think that we need to look into HDMI/Fiber TX/RX as the problem or the Extron switcher needs to be configured differently to interface with the TX/RX. I was told to hold off on troubleshooting this connectivity issue further since it involved me putting in more time.\r\nI recommend a follow up visit to look deeper into the problem.\r\nClient should be billed\r\n$121 50ft HDMI\r\n\r\n",

They have an AMX controller, AMX DGX64x64 switcher, 3 network switches passing AV OVER IP and Dante. They have a Biamp DSP with Shure ceiling mics.\r\n\r\n-I called AMX tech-support and inquired with them about performing a firmware update to their 64 x 64 switcher. The switcher was currently at version 3.6.29 which was only one version away from the most current version which is 3.6.30. I went ahead and pushed a firmware update to it. The update was successful and may have resolved some of their video issues they were having.\r\n\r\n-I did some troubleshooting of a couple of the workstations to determine where the point of failure was when trying to route the video. I narrowed it down to what I thought was a bad HDMI cable from one of the workstation's PC docking stations. (One of the stations did in fact have a broken HDMI cable) The HDMI cables ran back to the rack as home runs from the docking stations were missed labeled, on one label they had one set of numbers, and on the other label they had a different set which made it confusing and took a little time to determined what the input was of the station that was having the problem. Once I found the station I noticed that I wasn’t able to push video directly from my laptop into that input so I called AMX tech support again. We opened up the web GUI for the switcher and went to that input and as soon as I clicked on the input it began to see the signal and was working as it should.I’m not sure if opening up the software and initializing that channel caused it to refresh but literally it began to work right when I clicked on it.\r\n\r\n-After I resolved this issue, a new video issue surfaced where one of their overhead displays was no longer receiving a signal from a satellite tuner. I did various troubleshooting steps and couldn’t get to the bottom of it so I resolved to do a system reboot. I was thinking that when I was pulling out every input and output I could’ve caused some thing to lose it's sync and by rebooting it, Itwould re-initializeall video routing. my assumption was correct the reboot fixed their blue screen that they were getting at the display in question.\r\n\r\n-I also resolved an issue they were having with one of their overhead Shure mics no longer being online. I relanded it in the proper port on the network switch and it began to work as it should. I believe it may have inadvertently been plugged into the wrong port which would’ve caused the audionate software that routes the audio to stop recognizing it as a audio stream.",

Increased brightness to make up for this as much as possible for now.\r\nTried to get in touch with Vivitek Support, but could not get ahold of support.\r\n Spoke with Andre and his recommendation was to leave the projector on \"Bright\" setting for now. If need be reverting back to \"Presentation\" or \"User1\" will match the colors of the North and South projectors.\r\nDanny will return ASAP to take a closer look and possibly switch out the lamp. He will also bring a helper if the lamp needs to be switched out as it requires two people due to the projector lift.",

                "notes": " was able to get everything back up and running in the Exec huddle room. The Touch Panel was completely frozen up, which is different then the last issue of not working wirelessly and no video. I verified everything was communicating and had power, everything showed network connectivity. I called AMX and they walked me through how to reboot the touch panel manually using the stylus and inserting it into a slot on the side, I showed Daniel, so he knows if this should happen again. After the touch panel rebooted and began to work as it should both wired and wireless, I noticed I had lost all video at the displays, briefly I got an intermittent signal but definitely not consistent. tried adjusting and relanding the cables still nothing at the right display, got the left to work consistently unless the rack is pulled out. After troubleshooting and ruling out everything, I determined that the HDMI to the right screen was bad and would need to be replaced, With much effort I replaced the cable and got it working consistently, however the rack work is very precarious, its meant to be a pull and turn but its not, you basically lift it all up and twist it around. Every time the rack is moved around you lose video due to the cabling at the switcher. The HDMI cables are large and rigid.The cable I used to replace the bad HDMI was not as rigid as the other ones, it seemed to handle movement better.  We may want to have a couple guy's out to replace the cable to the left display with one not so big and rigid, and also clean up how the rack is done. Maybe put an actual pull and turn in, if possible. But for now its all running, just dont touch anything!!",

When I went to share from laptop 2 I got video but no audio. I rebooted the transmitter at the table and the audio immediately came up. It was just hung up, this interface doesnt get alot of use. There are a couple of steps to get the audio to work when sharing presentations, the system is not set up to have the audio auto follow the video. There is a button on the touch panel that says \"hear selected video source\" this must be be selected for the audio to play in the room system. The second issue was the Display Port to HDMI cable at the rack that the rack laptop was utilizing was not passing audio. When we replaced it with a HDMI-HDMI and used a display port adapter we got the audio to work at the laptop with a NASA laptop but you have to go into the settings of the laptop and tell it to send audio out via the display port and not the headphones. The laptop that they where using seemed to have an issue with its audio out, when Dwayne tried hais or I tried mine it worked fine. The client needs a new Display Port to HDMI adapter.  ",

A reboot resolved this. They said they had recent power failures and the switcher/ processor wasnt working, it probably just needed to be turned back on after the re-boot. the next problem reported was no far side audio from one of the codecs but when you switched codecs you got the audio from the other codec. The end user had moved inputs around in the soundstructure attempting to integrate a wireless mic array into the system. Art altered the code so the audio from both codecs is active no matter which is selected resolving the issue. The next issue was a problem the end user was having connecting a roaming Ipad to the 3rd floor AV system. I discovered the Ipad had been set to DHCP which is not how the system was designed to work. We located the correct IP configuration and where able to connect to the Network but unable to establish communication consistently. End user said they had made changes to their network recently. I suggested that they verify that these Ip configurations are free  and not in Ip conflict with other devices. The IP address I was given to use when working on the system did not work. I was unable to establish communication to the gear via the network. I also suggested they attempt to connect to the 6th floor system to determine if the room is specific to the 3rd floor. ",

This RMA no. will be used for tracking the unit through the service evaluation process.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  This Solution I.D. no. will expire after 6 months from the original assignment date.  Once the number has expired, you must call into the Technical Support Department at 770.420.1350 to receive another Solution ID, should you wish to send in the unit for evaluation.\r\n\r\n    Ship your projector/processor in for service using the following address:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDigital Projection, Inc.\r\n\r\n55 Chastain Road\r\n\r\nSuite 115\r\n\r\nKennesaw, GA  30144\r\n\r\nAttn:  Service Department/SI # 133887\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    Please notate the SI No. 133887 on the outside of the box in bold numbers.\r\n    Using your original packaging with original packaging materials is the safest way to return the unit to us.\r\n    Please note if using new packaging materials, do not use foam pellets/peanuts. \r\n    It is important to stabilize the projector or processor in solid/stout/shock resistant packaging, so that it does not move around during shipment and the box does not collapse.\r\n    It is NOT RECOMMENDED that any type of Ground Freight Service be used when shipping your projector or processor.  The risk of damage during shipping rises sharply when this type of freight service is selected.  Always make sure to insure your shipment appropriately in the event damage does occur during transit.\r\n    Please remove the ceiling mount from your projector before shipping to our warehouse.\r\n    IF your projector has a removable lens, please remove the lens before shipping, as significant damage can occur if the lens is shipped while installed in the projector.  The service department will not need your lens to complete the service evaluation.  NOTE:  If your projector is an IVISION OR MVISION model type, the lens can’t be removed.  Trying to remove the lens in this instance would cause excessive damage to the projector.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe appreciate your trust in Digital Projection, Inc. to provide you with assistance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNique Davenport\r\n\r\nTech Support Lead",

I factory reset the box and got the same error message twice, now on component video out telling me that the box did reset but it did not fix the issue.HDX should be rpeaired/replaced.\r\n\r\nWhile I was trouble shooting the issue I noticed the second codec .5 was blinking on the front from amber to green, not something it usually does, I selected this codec and it was giving me a \"failure to load audio dsp memory\" message and would not reboot. I factory reset the box and now it will not boot up past thge Polycom screen which is a tell tale sign that the unit should be repaired or replaced. So as of now both codec in Philly are non functional. We will look into options to get this resolved asap.\r\nWe had the client ship two replacement codecs and I went up to Philly and installed them.\r\n\r\nBoth HDX 8000's where under warranty and after trouble-shooting it was determined both units had failed and needed to be replaced. Polycom issued advance replacements.\r\n\r\nI received the new codecs and scheduled a time to reinstall them in the DC office. \r\n\r\nI installed the two replacement codecs. One of them in the 2nd floor Americas, and the other in a mobile cart. Configured and tested. ",

I looked into the configuration and reached out to Atlona for support to see if this was a known issue resolved by a firmware update or changes to the configuration. Their technician guided me through some changes that needed to be made to the switcher. We set the edid table to a fixed resolution rather then on auto making it easier for the Mac to maintain the handshake at 1080p 2 channel. I opened up the display settings and verified the MacMini was seeing the Atlona and it was. Tested by playing a video and did not loose the signal except when the system was being rebooted for other unrelated changes. It came right back up by selecting the MacMini as the source after the reboot.\r\n\r\n-Projector no longer powering off/on when prompted.     \r\n\r\nLooked into control issue and figured out it  was a network problem since it was controlled over IP. Contacted programmer to verify the code had the correct IP address for the projector and it did not. It was set 10.?.?.107 and the projector was 10.?.?.107. I assume it is an issue with everything being hdcp for this system, a reboot will cause gear to get a new address. A network admin should assign addresses to the gear to fix this on the network side. We modified the code to fix it on our end. Tested the start up and shutdown routine it is working as it should. Did notice upon my arrival that the projector had been left on all night. This will have negative impact on the life of the lamps and the projector.\r\n\r\n-Mic not working/ Problem with levels and level control.\r\n\r\nThe mic that wasn't working was assigned to the wrong group/channel. Matched Mic with RX group/channel and the mic began to work. For the Audio level issue being to low to the far side maxed out and still not loud enough we raised the mic level by +6Db. For control we changed the Dsp config for discreet control of Mic level/Program audio/audio conference.\r\nDid testing and had good sound quality and control over audio. ",

                "notes": " I was on site the first issue they are having is in their ballroom they have a CD player that they also use as an aux input, its no longer working. its Made by Beolab The speakers are powered and are proprietary to the device although I did research and find that you can buy a dongle to make the speakers work with other receivers. I tried to send a signal directly to the speakers but was unable to get any sound to go through them from the cable at the CD player. I did notice a couple of them were off. I got on the lift and went up and turned one of them back on and when I went back down the lift died and needed to be charged So I couldn’t go up and investigate anymore. I need to verify that the speakers are working if we’re going to quote them some thing that incorporates the speakers we’re going to need the dongle from the manufacturer it takes the nine pin din and makes it into two RCA’s. I need to verify the cabling is good and or the cable path to run new cabling. Then we can quote them some thing as a replacement for the CD player they said they would like an IPad. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second thing they had me look at where Mic inputs that they had in various rooms. I believe one of them was called the boiler room.    They have no drawing and they weren’t sure where the mic inputs went to. The sound was no longer working in the room from the inputs or from the hotel sound system. I traced the lines back to a DSP mixer made by Crown. When I traced the path out of the DSP/mixer into the Crown amplifier array. I discovered that the amplifier that serves that room and various other zones in the hotel would no longer power on. which was the next thing they wanted me to look at. I replaced the cord and plugged it directly into the outlet and still nothing. I swapped the iec cord from one of the working amps still nothing.The Crown amplifier will need to be replaced. I recommend they use the one that Crown recommends as the replacement to avoid having to reconfigure their system and make for an easy swap. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI looked at a Soundsystem that they have in their lobby where they have a mixer sending a signal out to powered speakers that are in the corners and the cabling is ran under the carpets along the side and under the steps. They would like to look into some alternatives to the set up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso they have various audio controllers potentiometers that are supposed to control the level of the Audio in the various zones these controllers no longer work. They are very old and I would have to troubleshoot to figure out how they’re connected and how they worked it’s not really worth it they need to be quoted a new audio system for the entire hotel",

I noticed that when you plugged in the HDMI cable sometimes it wasn’t recognizing audio and lighting up green.\r\n-I traced their audio issue back to the output of the AMX switcher. A previous company had spliced together a stereo output for left and right speakers. The cables were poorly spliced and ground was lifted but that wasn’t the only issue on the Phoenix blox of the AMX switcher itself, it is very hard to get the cables to be captive in the Phoenix blox they’re not the kind that screw in there the kind that are supposed to auto lock and these are not auto locking it was very difficult to get them to stay in place If they lift at all out of the block the speaker noise immediately begins. I did my best to get it in place and retired the splice. The noise went away. The guy Michael said two companies have been out attempting to fix it and he was impressed that I was the one who found itThe guy Michael said two companies have been out attempting to fix it and he was impressed that I was the one who found it and was able toidentify the root cause.  I took a couple of the phoenix blocks with me back to the shop so I can look at them and figure out how to get the cables to lock in. I may need to use a different gauge cable than what they were using on site. I called Frank Steinert about it and asked him. he said they were supposed to auto click in from his recollection. AMX must know these blocks are an issue because I don’t see them on their new models.\r\n\r\n-There second touch panel that is supposed to have a wireless capability disconnects and doesn't connect to their wireless network when unlocked. I verified settings it may need a password entered.",

I verified I had connectivity and that the system was online. I did notice that when you selected lectern computer you got the laptop and when you selected laptop you got nothing. I found that they had two DM transmitters under the lectern. One had no connectivity and was unplugged, the other was connected to the computer. I figured it got its cabling moved around. Powered up the one that was not hooked up and got it working. Inquired with the end user how they would like it to be and they requested I hook it up the way it was designed. I replaced the HDMI cable for the laptop and got everything working as it should. ",

They verified that the processor was \"frozen\" and began to try and determine what the cause was. They looked at the code, the devices tree, and how the ports were addressed. They looked at the logs and found that the system had locked up over the weekend on Saturday at 1:30 pm. They suspected that it may be an issue related to the Java allocated memory. The engineer changed the settings from 64 to 128 to see if this fixes it. He told us to wait and see if it locks up again after the weekend and if it doesn't to go ahead and make the change to room 107 as well. If it does freeze up again we need to look deeper at what may be the culprit. We plan on being onsite Tuesday September 3rd to check the state of the system after the long weekend. ",

They verified that the processor was \"frozen\" and began to try and determine what the cause was. They looked at the code, the devices tree, and how the ports were addressed. They looked at the logs and found that the system had locked up over the weekend on Saturday at 1:30 pm. They suspected that it may be an issue related to the Java allocated memory. The engineer changed the settings from 64 to 128 to see if this fixes it. He told us to wait and see if it locks up again after the weekend and if it doesn't to go ahead and make the change to room 107 as well. If it does freeze up again we need to look deeper at what may be the culprit. We plan on being onsite Tuesday September 3rd to check the state of the system after the long weekend.",

I investigated and discovered that someone had plugged the cat6 network cable that carries the AV to the display into the wrong port on the receiver. It needs to be in the link port not the lan port.\r\n\r\nThe third and 4th issue where related to Cisco SX20 codecs. I had to reboot the codecs to get them to be responsive. I discovered that the codec controls have been password protected and my POC did not know the passwords. So I could not access the codecs. They need to chek with their IT dept. and see if the passwords have been documented otherwise they will need to be factory reset and reconfigured. The second codec was in a little huddle room it has a problem the codec camera is clicking and behaving in a way that suggests it is failing. Will need to troubleshoot once the password is retrieved or the device is factory reset.",

I did some troubleshooting and determined that it was the scaler that receives the video from the crestron  switcher. I took the scaler from their second display in the lunch room and swapped them. the problem followed wherever you put the scaler so it's definitely the scaler.

                "notes": "Went out and looked at their system issues with control and unresponsive cameras, I was able to replicate the control issue and made note that the system was not responding to start up routines even though it said the rooms where combined only the left projector cam on and the left screen went down, it only worked if manually selected, everything responded as it should just no start up routines and the system seemed to not track the state of the room such as combined/seperate I rebooted the system and still had the same issue I tricked the air wall sensor and got it to work right once but then it reverted back to the error state it was in. I suggested we get a programmer to look into whats happening in the code. Everything works it just requires being told what to turn on and how to route sources. I looked into the camera issue and immediate noticed the cameras where flickering and trying to boot up like they where not getting enough power.After trouble shooting I was unable to determine the cause and had ran out of time in the room. I decided to remove all three cameras and there associated Vaddio TX/RX devices to isolate the gear from their system and do a bench test with the cameras. Got the cameras back to the shop and determined that 2 out of 3 of the Vaddio TX's had failed and would need to be repaired, to repair was almost what it cost to replace them so Jordan opted to replace and not repair. to get a new warranty. the replace was $450  each our cost so $900 plus shipping. I received the new units and went out to reinstall them. I got out in the field hooked everything back up and had two of the cameras working and began to trouble shoot a problem with the third, this is just video, I hadnt even got to control yet, when I noticed the cameras acting funny and beginning to flicker and the indicator lights blinking just like they where when I found them failed, I immediately unhooked everything to avoid further damage, thinking we had a power issue related to the cabling because it didnt do this when testing at the shop. I ran out of time and had to set up another visit with a longer time slot to continue trouble shooting. Researched this issue and began to think that the codec may have been updated but not the cameras causing one issue and that the control between the cameras may be causing a power problem I looked into how to make the control jumper cable properly. I got back in the field and got the cameras all to power up and and run stable without connecting the control daisy chain I suspected to be the culprit. I got all three cameras to update  to the most current firmware by placing each one as the first location. I re terminated the RJ45/RJ11 to Ciscos specification but still could not get the control to daisy chain, I had Camera 1 working perfectly.Video and control. I tested a proprietary Tandberg camera daisy chain control cable I had with me by extending it with a coupler and got it to work. I opened up the ceiling and ran the extended line to camera 2, then I ran a second tandberg cable to the 3rd camera and was ab;e to control all 3 cameras. Still I had no video from camera three, I began to troubleshoot, and ran out of time in the room, which is highly used. I spoke with Jordan and he said he was happy to have two cameras up and running and that we can address the third camera at a later date.",

I had to resend it the project file to get it working again. I verified that everything was running the most recent version of firmware and the system is up to date as far as firmware. I reached out to Crestron to see about getting an advance replacement but the time to get an advance replacement under warranty has expired.

They where right out of the box purchased a few years earlier when we installed the new projector we must of got them as back ups or from another project. They would not get recognized by the projector so it would not come on. I tried multple times and eventually called the manufacturer Digital Projection to get tech support after some trouble shooting they informed me that these lamps had gone bad and where out of warranty I would have to purchase new lamps. Apparently these lamps have a shelve life (something I had never heard of). I reinstalled the on lamp that was still working in the dual lamp projector to keep them running while I waited for the new lamps. I received the new lamps and installed them with no issues. Replaced the filters as per the recommendations for proper care of the projector.  ",

Just guessing, but I've seen this before. Usually the programmer builds in a refresh if the system sits idol but sometimes it freezes before this process is triggered. I will talk to our programmer about this. Lets just watch the system and contact me if problems persist.",

The returned it and said nothing was wrong with it. I reinstalled it and the problem reoccurred. I thought it may be related to a short with the antennas or a power failure so I did the troubleshooting  again and ruled out the possible sources of the failure. cabling, power, antenna. I called Shure again and created a new repair order and shipped it for repair. I got the receiver back they said they replaced the mother board this time which made sense since it seemed like the failure could of been a failed circuit which would work then short. when I reinstalled the receiver  it wouldn't work at all and showed the wrong frequencies of television channels. I called Shure again and they told me to ship it back they had put the wrong region motherboard in by mistake. I  received and installed the repaired receiver and ran it through testing it is finally back up and running.      ",

At first I suspected it was the VGA splitters or KVM switches that where causing the signal to degrade but after purchasing new ones it did not fix the problem. I noticed that when I ran my laptop through the KVM switch and the VGA splitter just like they do, I had no issue, my image was not effected by horizontal sinc lines going down the screen. I suggested they have their IT group look into different resolutions  to see if they can correct it that way. I hdeard from them after they tried this and they still had an issue though not as bad. They said they are looking into replacing the graphic card in the pc;s that are used in the rooms. ",

At first I suspected it was the VGA splitters or KVM switches that where causing the signal to degrade but after purchasing new ones it did not fix the problem. I noticed that when I ran my laptop through the KVM switch and the VGA splitter just like they do, I had no issue, my image was not effected by horizontal sinc lines going down the screen. I suggested they have their IT group look into different resolutions  to see if they can correct it that way. I hdeard from them after they tried this and they still had an issue though not as bad. They said they are looking into replacing the graphic card in the pc;s that are used in the rooms.",

Sent a command to the processor to reboot and it began to work I had audio but still had no control. Rebooted Dsp and switcher. got everything working had audio from laptop interfaces and control over the levels. Went to verify functionality to client and it began to have issues again. I had audio but I could not turn it down via the touch panel. I could turn it up and down via the AMX hard button controller just not the ipad. I noticed while testing that the the control over the levels flipped-meaning I couldn't turn it down but I could turn it up, then it switched and I could turn it down just not up. I verified rs232 db9 cabling and contacted Art to see if he could see what was going on in the programming. We discovered that the AMX hard button was hanging up the audio up/down in the code for instance if you select levelUp on the hard button you could no longer turn it up via the Ipad, the same was true if you selected levelDown. but if you chose a preset it released it and you had control again. a change needs to be made to the code. Showed end user a work around while we make figure out and make the changes to the code. I have scheduled a time to load the edited code get it resolved.",

Rebooting the processor resolved this and everything seemed to be working as it should. \r\n\r\nWhen I went to test the Barco/Clickshare no audio issue, I found that just as reported I had video with no problems, but no audio, I verified I had audio working from the tuner and both table interfaces to rule out a potential system wide audio problem, had audio routing just as it should from all sources but the clickshare. I ran my laptop direct into the Crestron wallplate/interface and had video and audio. So now I was convinced it was the clickshare. I reached out to a colleague who has worked with the clickshares and he recomend we check its setting and verify its running the most recent firmware version. We verified it had the correct configuration the audio was turned on. We attempted with no success to update the firmware with no luck, we got a could not update error trying it direct usb and over the ethernet with no success we where really starting to think it was the clickshare. So I got one from a different room still had no audio. I remarried the pucks to the base, still no audio, I created a case with Barco, I was about to just bring the clickshare back to our office since it looked like I would need to troubleshoot it with Barco when they respond to my service request, I decided to plug it directly into the display to see if I had audio coming out of it and I did, telling me it was somthing else in the system that was causing this. I connected to the headend and had our enginneer look intot the system and see if he could see why the audio was not routing via the interface plate from the barco, we discovered that the switcher was seeing the input as a dvi signal not an hdmi and thus not seeing the audi since a dvi signal does not pass audio. We now needed to reach out to Crestron and see if this was somthing they had seen before. I got tech support on the phone and after some troubleshooting they told me that this is a known issue, that there is a chip set in the Barco that is incompatible witht the Crestron HDbaseT TX/RX's they said we either add scalers inline between the clickshares and interface or replace the tx/rx's.

                "notes": "1-The discrete video card in our new Dell cannot resolve either the frequency or the resolution of the settings of the Crestron. On board video works with the Crestron’s output. The video card will almost immediately lose lock and generate snow.\r\n\r\n-For the PC video card problem, just as reported I had an image from the output card of the PC and then it went all snowy static. This immediately made me think this was an HDCP issue since we still had an image, it was just static, verified I had the pc desktop on a monitor, ran my own laptop in with no issue, I looked into the configuration of the transmitter and the receiver and had HDCP turned on through the chain, but it still said non-hdcp supported on the incoming video, called an engineer to look into the switcher's set up to see if he could find if it was a resolution issue caused by an edid table needing to be adjusted, we took some resolutions out and noticed it was seeing two edid tables the one for the output card and the one for the smart monitor symposium. We took out the smart monitors table and it began to work as it should. Thought we had resolved it and moved on to the next thing. However, the following week I was contacted and told the problem had resurfaced.\r\n\r\nOn my second visit 3/15 I ruled out all cabling and adapters at the in/outs at the lectern, verified it wasnt the switcher by setting up my own receiver and monitor and it happened again. Called Crestron tech support and went over the issue with them to see if we could resolve it with a newer firmware or a configuration change. Their engineer logged into your system and looked into how it was set up for the video flow as far as resolutions, hdcp, edid, tables, and displays. We tried some things, then we noticed if you relanded the cable out of the monitor it would correct itself, but then if the computer went to sleep, or turned off the problem would recur, we plugged unplugged and it would auto correct, telling us it is definitely the smart monitor, the Crestron device loses its incoming voltage (hotshot) and the connection is lost. He suggested you do not pass the signal through the smart monitor from that pc output card into the trsansmitter, it is confusing the Crestron transmitter, He said graphics cards can \"outsmart\" the system sometimes by trying to push resolutions it cant handle, for instance, the edid of the display was in the table and it can do 3d, the card saw this and tried to push that through, which your system does not support. I asked him if we should upgrade the firmware, and he said no. You wouldnt want it to crash, since you dont have the code, sometimes after an update it requires a code recompile, if you dont have it, your system is wiped clean. There is one more thing our engineer thought we could try, the transmitter has a local monitor out, we could send the signal from the video card into the transmitter first, then utilize the local monitor output for the symposium, it may resolve the static issue and the glitchy lines that sometimes occur. I can come out and try this. For now it works through the HDMI out of the PC.\r\n\r\n2-The audio volume level from the PC and the DVD player is too low.\r\n\r\n-When I looked into this problem I immediately noticed I had no control over the audio levels at all. no mute/unmute, up/down levels, and no feed back, which made me think that the processor was no longer communicating with the DSP that handles the audio which is made by QSC. I noticed on the front panel it was set to dhcp, which made me think that it had rebooted and lost the address it once had which made it unreachable by the processor, had engineer log into the system and take a look at the network tree. We found the the dsp to be offline just as suspected, it was looking to communicate at .114 and the QSC was at .117. We changed it at the processor and we got it working again. I was able to control the audio. I bumped up the audio levels a little to ensure proper headroom for dvd/laptop audio. The programmer changed the system to reserve the proper ip for the dsp based on its mac address.\r\n\r\n3-The Wireless lavalier mics and the wired mics will not work. No sound comes from the rack\r\n\r\n-For this issue it was a challenge. I verified I had audio from the lavalieres and handhelds by running them into a known working receiver and I had signal just not at the correct inputs. telling me it wasnt the mics/lavalieres or the  wireless rx's. I figured either the matrix was  not configured properluy or the levels are to low. I had never looked at this particular manufacturers  DSP (audio processor) before. I went online read up on it and downloaded the software I would need to look at it and communicate to it. I called tech support once I had the software to walk me through connecting and configuring the device. We noticed it was way out of date as far a firmware, so much so that I had to download an out of date version of the software to communicate, once I got this all figured out, we went in and looked at the gain structure as well as the audio in/out matrix. We found the level for the wall inputs and the lavalieres where set to -60dB making them inaudible, we set the levels to the correct gain and the problem was fixed. The technician said that if we wanted to upgrade the firmware we would have to do it incrementally one version at a time and it is like 15 out, but we should be cautious, if its all working and your not trying to upgrade, leave it alone. There may be something in the code that caused these levels to change. The technician made a note pad in the device that will create a message if the levels are changed so we can see when it happens. He said the audio was set up with good linear logic but could be set up better as far as gain structure.",

The video card will almost immediately lose lock and generate snow.\r\n\r\n-For the PC video card problem, just as reported I had an image from the output card of the PC and then it went all snowy static.

Its designed to have a DM receiver to be connected to the DM output. Then you can route the video were you would like such as a confidence monitor. This may have been the cause of the issue although I'm not 100%. I did do a couple things to try and stabilize the video flow. I put a Crestron scaler in line before it hits the Wirless transmitter that feeds video to the confidence monitor. My thinking is that the Cretsron switcher will now see a known device so it wont drop off trying to determine what its connected to. I have the scaler set to the resolution of the confidence monitor on its output 1920X1080P. I also replaced the DVI-HDMI adapter that was being utilized at the monitor  sometimes it s these adapters that cause our headaches from the source to the endpoint it can lose data because of the adapter it will drop off and try and renegotiate the digital hand shake causing an intermittent drop. After these steps the video was very stable",
